# Android learning journey

Foreword:

Since joining the Android Lab in 2016, I have been exposed to Android programming and purchased the first book "The First Line of Code" related to Android development. I am deeply attracted by Android development. It can be said that in my mental process of learning programming, Android development can be said to be the middle line, which runs through my learning career.

## 2016

+ When I first entered the school in my freshman year, I was curious about everything. At that time, my advisor, who was already a junior at that time, learned about the school's Android lab with us. As the vice chairman of the Youth League Committee of the college, he Possess exceptional personal abilities. Under his propaganda, I also entered the Android Lab with a curious attitude to study.

+ When I entered the Android Lab in 2016, through a week of training, I briefly learned the C language, but I still need to consolidate the school curriculum. Through Mr. Jing Chao's explanation in the class, I really understood and understood the path of programming.

+ In 2016, I not only learned C language, but also gradually came into contact with Java programming and development, because Android development is actually written in Java language (in the beginning, now there is kotlin). So I continue to learn Java development while following the weekly training in Android Labs. In the last winter vacation, the laboratory's requirement for every freshman and sophomore is to write an app independently, and I also implemented an app of my own during the winter vacation.

`Java Basics:`

+ [Head First Java](https://github.com/kentanvictor/STUDY/blob/master/PDF/Head%20First%20Java%EF%BC%88%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89.pdf)

+ [Java concurrent programming practice](https://github.com/kentanvictor/STUDY/blob/master/PDF/Java%E5%B9%B6%E5%8F%91%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B%E5%AE%9E%E6%88%98%EF%BC%88%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89.pdf)

+ [Effective Java](https://github.com/kentanvictor/STUDY/blob/master/PDF/Effective%2BJava%2B%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E7%89%88.pdf)

## 2017

+ During 2017, it should be regarded as the year that I made the most rapid progress in Android learning. During this year, the course of the school also opened the course of Java programming, so I not only followed the learning progress of the laboratory, but also passed the school. The courses solidified my foundation. During this period, I also tried through the ghostwriting group of a treasure, and made a fortune by writing code for the first time. **I still do not recommend individuals to take up such outsourcing projects during school, because in this way, your taste for learning will change.**

+ While writing the code of the Android client, I also learned courses such as database, data structure, C++, etc., and also learned multi-threading and Android custom controls. I have tried to imitate others to write one by myself. own project. Such as: [Aircraft War](https://github.com/kentanvictor/AirScraftDemo), [Weather app](https://github.com/kentanvictor/CoolWeather) and so on.

`Programmer must:`

+ [GitHub Getting Started and Practice](https://github.com/kentanvictor/STUDY/blob/master/PDF/GitHub%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8%E4%B8%8E%E5%AE%9E%E8%B7%B5.pdf)

+ [discrete mathematics and its applications](https://github.com/kentanvictor/STUDY/blob/master/PDF/%E7%A6%BB%E6%95%A3%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6%E5%8F%8A%E5%85%B6%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8.pdf)

+ [math for programmers](https://github.com/kentanvictor/STUDY/blob/master/PDF/%E7%A8%8B%E5%BA%8F%E5%91%98%E7%9A%84%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6.pdf)

## 2018

+ When I was in my third year of college, I was exposed to the lower-level things of Android development. I also learned courses such as computer network, operating system, computer composition principle, software engineering and other courses through school courses. Implement small ideas by writing code. I also try to open my eyes to different programming languages or other fun things, such as: [Django local server](https://github.com/kentanvictor/DjangoTest). But Android still maintains learning and practice, such as: [Car Mall](https://github.com/kentanvictor/CarRepair).

+ I have also been involved in the development of Android sensors. During this period, I also completed an Android sensor-related development project: [Android Sensor](https://github.com/kentanvictor/SensorMonitor)

`基础：`

+ [大话设计模式](https://github.com/kentanvictor/STUDY/blob/master/PDF/%E5%A4%A7%E8%AF%9D%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1%E6%A8%A1%E5%BC%8F.pdf)

+ [啊哈！算法！](https://github.com/kentanvictor/STUDY/blob/master/PDF/%E5%95%8A%E5%93%88%EF%BC%81%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95%EF%BC%81.pdf)

+ [算法](https://github.com/kentanvictor/STUDY/blob/master/PDF/%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95%EF%BC%88%E7%AC%AC%E5%9B%9B%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89.pdf)
  
## 2019年

+ 2019年，我跟随着学校的课程，在井超老师的教导下学会了Java企业级应用开发，也接触到了Spring、SpringMVC、Mybatis、Springboots等用于后端开发的工具。我也能够更好的去为我的Android客户端项目进行一个整体的完善。Android相当于前端，而JavaEE去编写的，是后端服务器中的内容。

+ 同年，我也在学习了网络编程的课程后，了解到了socket套接字通信，这让我在软硬件交互上更能够去进行交互，这也让我最终能够去接触到硬件相关的知识与开发。因为实验室需要参加比赛的缘故，我接触到了计算机视觉的相关知识，学习了OpenCV的使用与其中关于双目立体视觉的算法。

## 2020年

+ 我依旧在学习，在学习新知识的同时不断地回顾以前学习过的基础，作为一名程序员，最最重要的是数据结构、算法与编程语言的运用，从最初编程语言基础的学习，到进阶学习这门编程语言的独特之处，最终涉及到其底层的数据结构与算法相关的理解。慢慢地就会发现，原来编程是这么有趣的一件事情。
